      <h2>Streamlining Coaching: The Need for All-in-One Sports Platforms</h2>
      <p>
        Coaching apps have evolved, but many only address specific needs, forcing
        teams like Florida Tech Menâ€™s Lacrosse to use multiple apps. This fragmentation
        reveals a demand for an all-in-one platform, offering opportunities for innovation
        in sports tech.

<!-- This project focuses on addressing the challenges sports
teams face due to the need for multiple specialized apps,
particularly smaller teams and communities with limited resources.
By developing a cross-sport app, we aim to consolidate various
functionalities into a single, user-friendly platform, reducing
the reliance on multiple apps. This approach not only makes the
app more affordable for smaller teams but also increases its
appeal across different sports, fostering greater competition
and expanding market share in a space with limited competition.
The project will explore ways to enhance app functionality,
ensuring it meets the diverse needs of users while maintaining
affordability and accessibility. -->
