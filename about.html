    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
      This project focuses on addressing the challenges sports
      teams face due to the need for multiple specialized apps,
      particularly smaller teams and communities with limited resources.
      By developing a cross-sport app, we aim to consolidate various
      functionalities into a single, user-friendly platform, reducing
      the reliance on multiple apps. This approach not only makes the
      app more affordable for smaller teams but also increases its
      appeal across different sports, fostering greater competition
      and expanding market share in a space with limited competition.
      The project will explore ways to enhance app functionality,
      ensuring it meets the diverse needs of users while maintaining
      affordability and accessibility.
